## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Using Azure Content Safety Custom Categories

This project includes a sample file `survival-advice.jsonl` which contains various survival tips. This file can be used as training data for creating custom content categories using Azure Content Safety.

For detailed instructions on how to create and train custom content categories, refer to the [Azure Content Safety quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-custom-categories).
